# Cheese Collection Project

· Used PHP and a local RDBMS (MariaDB)

· Content is dynamic

· Structured the files so that I am not repeating headers, etc. for every page

Allows the creation of new pages by adding records to the database (no other files needed)

Used the database to store the navigation system (menu)

Allows a user to login, have the pages “be affected” by login status using cookies

Has a list of my collection at the 'Summary' page

Has a slide show
