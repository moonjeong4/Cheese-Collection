            The production process is similar to that of other soft cheeses. The goat's milk is heated and coagulated with the addition of rennet, and then drained and molded into the desired shape. The cheese is then aged for varying periods of time, ranging from a few days to several months, which affects its flavor and texture. It is a versatile ingredient that can be used in a variety of dishes. Its tangy flavor and crumbly texture make it a popular choice for salads, pizzas, sandwiches, and even desserts. It can also be enjoyed on its own as a snack or appetizer.
